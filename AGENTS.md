# AGENTS.md — fastapi_rust

> Guidelines for AI coding agents working on the FastAPI-to-Rust port.

---

## Project Overview

**fastapi_rust** is an ULTRA-OPTIMIZED Rust web framework inspired by FastAPI's developer experience. We're building this from scratch with minimal dependencies, co-developing with the [asupersync](file:///data/projects/asupersync) async runtime.

### Key Principles

1. **Extract spec from legacy → implement from spec → NEVER translate line-by-line**
2. **Minimal dependencies** — Only asupersync + serde
3. **Zero-copy where possible** — Parse directly from request buffers
4. **No runtime reflection** — Everything resolved at compile time via proc macros
5. **Cancel-correct** — Leverage asupersync's structured concurrency

### Related Projects

| Project | Location | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| fastapi_rust | `/data/projects/fastapi_rust` | **This project** — Rust web framework |
| asupersync | `/data/projects/asupersync` | Custom async runtime (co-developed) |
| legacy_fastapi | `./legacy_fastapi/` | Python FastAPI source (reference only) |

## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PEROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time.

---

## Porting Methodology

### The Three Documents

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `PLAN_TO_PORT_FASTAPI_TO_RUST.md` | Scope, exclusions, phases | ✅ Created |
| `EXISTING_FASTAPI_STRUCTURE.md` | **THE SPEC** — complete behavior extraction | 🔜 Next |
| `PROPOSED_RUST_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Rust design decisions | Pending |

### Critical Rules

1. **After reading the spec, you should NOT need legacy code**
2. **Never translate Python to Rust line-by-line**
3. **Extract behaviors and data structures, not implementation details**
4. **Consult ONLY the spec doc during implementation**

### Deep Dive Extraction Prompts

When extracting to the spec document:

```
Do a comprehensive deep dive into [SUBSYSTEM] at [EXACT PATH].

Extract EXACTLY:
- All data structures with all fields
- Validation rules with exact conditions
- Default values (not approximate)
- Error handling behaviors

EXCLUDE: [List of out-of-scope items per PLAN]

This is research only - do not write any code.
```

---

## Toolchain: Rust & Cargo

We only use **Cargo** in this project, NEVER any other package manager.

- **Edition:** Rust 2024 (nightly required)
- **Dependency versions:** Explicit versions for stability
- **Configuration:** Cargo.toml only
- **Unsafe code:** Minimize, document when necessary

### Minimal Dependency Stack

| Crate | Purpose | Why Essential |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `asupersync` | Async runtime | **OUR OWN** — cancel-correct, capability-secure |
| `serde` | Serialization traits | Industry standard, zero-cost |
| `serde_json` | JSON parsing | Fast, well-optimized |

### Explicitly NOT Using

| Crate | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| tokio | Using asupersync instead |
| hyper | Building our own HTTP |
| Axum | Too many layers, hidden allocations |
| Tower | Service trait overhead unnecessary |
| utoipa | Runtime schema building |

---

## Co-Development with Asupersync

This project is developed in tandem with asupersync. Changes may need to be made in both repos.

### Asupersync Current State

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Scheduler (3-lane) | ✅ Implemented |
| Capability context (Cx) | ✅ Implemented |
| Channels (oneshot, mpsc) | ✅ Implemented |
| **Future execution loop** | 🔜 Phase 0 |
| **I/O integration** | 🔜 Phase 2 |

### When Working on Both Projects

1. Check which components exist in asupersync before building in fastapi_rust
2. If asupersync needs a feature, implement it there first
3. Use asupersync's `Cx` pattern for request context
4. Leverage structured concurrency for request handling

---

## Code Editing Discipline

### No Script-Based Changes

**NEVER** run a script that processes/changes code files in this repo. Brittle regex-based transformations create far more problems than they solve.

### No File Proliferation

If you want to change something or add a feature, **revise existing code files in place**.

**NEVER** create variations like:
- `mainV2.rs`
- `main_improved.rs`
- `main_enhanced.rs`

---

## Backwards Compatibility

We do not care about backwards compatibility—we're in early development with no users. We want to do things the **RIGHT** way with **NO TECH DEBT**.

---

## Compiler Checks (CRITICAL)

**After any substantive code changes, you MUST verify no errors were introduced:**

```bash
# Check for compiler errors and warnings
cargo check --all-targets

# Check for clippy lints
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Verify formatting
cargo fmt --check
```

---

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources. Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

### Why It's Useful

- **Prevents conflicts:** Explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs
- **Token-efficient:** Messages stored in per-project archive, not in context
- **Quick reads:** `resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`

### Same Repository Workflow

1. **Register identity:**
   ```
   ensure_project(project_key=<abs-path>)
   register_agent(project_key, program, model)
   ```

2. **Reserve files before editing:**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/router/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
   ```

3. **Communicate with threads:**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")
   fetch_inbox(project_key, agent_name)
   acknowledge_message(project_key, agent_name, message_id)
   ```

### Cross-Project Coordination

When working on both fastapi_rust and asupersync:
- Register in both projects
- Use Mail to coordinate changes that span both repos
- Reserve files in the project you're actively editing

### Macros vs Granular Tools

- **Prefer macros for speed:** `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`
- **Use granular tools for control:** `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`

### Common Pitfalls

- `"from_agent not registered"`: Always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first
- `"FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT"`: Adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation

## Beads (br) — Dependency-Aware Issue Tracking

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and CLI (`br`) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status.

**Note:** `br` (beads_rust) is non-invasive and never executes git commands. You must run git commands manually after `br sync --flush-only`.

### Typical Agent Flow

1. **Pick ready work (Beads):**
   ```bash
   br ready --json  # Choose highest priority, no blockers
   ```

2. **Reserve edit surface (Mail):**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")
   ```

3. **Announce start (Mail):**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <title>", ack_required=true)
   ```

4. **Work and update:** Reply in-thread with progress

5. **Complete and release:**
   ```bash
   br close br-123 --reason "Completed"
   ```
   ```
   release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])
   ```

### Mapping Cheat Sheet

| Concept | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Mail `thread_id` | `br-###` |
| Mail subject | `[br-###] ...` |
| File reservation `reason` | `br-###` |
| Commit messages | Include `br-###` for traceability |

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage Engine

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`). It computes PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, and k-core metrics deterministically.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command
```

### Command Reference

**Planning:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles |

### jq Quick Reference

```bash
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
```

## UBS — Ultimate Bug Scanner

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

### Commands

```bash
ubs file.rs file2.rs                    # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs --only=rust,toml src/               # Language filter (3-5x faster)
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning .            # CI mode — before PR
ubs .                                   # Whole project (ignores target/, Cargo.lock)
```

### Output Format

```
Warning: Category (N errors)
    file.rs:42:5 – Issue description
    Suggested fix
Exit code: 1
```

Parse: `file:line:col` -> location | Suggested fix -> how to fix | Exit 0/1 -> pass/fail

### Fix Workflow

1. Read finding -> category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` -> view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` -> exit 0
6. Commit

## ast-grep vs ripgrep

**Use `ast-grep` when structure matters.** It parses code and matches AST nodes, ignoring comments/strings, and can **safely rewrite** code.

**Use `ripgrep` when text is enough.** Fastest way to grep literals/regex.

### Rule of Thumb

- Need correctness or **applying changes** -> `ast-grep`
- Need raw speed or **hunting text** -> `rg`
- Often combine: `rg` to shortlist files, then `ast-grep` to match/modify

### Rust Examples

```bash
# Find structured code (ignores comments)
ast-grep run -l Rust -p 'fn $NAME($$$ARGS) -> $RET { $$$BODY }'

# Find all unwrap() calls
ast-grep run -l Rust -p '$EXPR.unwrap()'

# Quick textual hunt
rg -n 'async fn' -t rust

# Combine speed + precision
rg -l -t rust 'Router' | xargs ast-grep run -l Rust -p 'impl Router' --json
```

## Morph Warp Grep — AI-Powered Code Search

**Use `mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep` for exploratory "how does X work?" questions.** An AI agent expands your query, greps the codebase, reads relevant files, and returns precise line ranges with full context.

**Use `ripgrep` for targeted searches.** When you know exactly what you're looking for.

### When to Use What

| Scenario | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| "How is the router implemented?" | `warp_grep` | Exploratory; don't know where to start |
| "Where is the request extractor logic?" | `warp_grep` | Need to understand architecture |
| "Find all uses of `serde_json`" | `ripgrep` | Targeted literal search |
| "Find files with `async fn`" | `ripgrep` | Simple pattern |
| "Replace all `unwrap()` with `expect()`" | `ast-grep` | Structural refactor |

### warp_grep Usage

```
mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep(
  repoPath: "/data/projects/fastapi_rust",
  query: "How does the routing system work with asupersync?"
)
```

Returns structured results with file paths, line ranges, and extracted code snippets.

### Anti-Patterns

- **Don't** use `warp_grep` to find a specific function name -> use `ripgrep`
- **Don't** use `ripgrep` to understand "how does X work" -> wastes time with manual reads
- **Don't** use `ripgrep` for codemods -> risks collateral edits

## cass — Cross-Agent Session Search

`cass` indexes prior agent conversations (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT, Aider, etc.) into a unified, searchable index so you can reuse solved problems.

**NEVER run bare `cass`** — it launches an interactive TUI. Always use `--robot` or `--json`.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Check if index is healthy (exit 0=ok, 1=run index first)
cass health

# Search across all agent histories
cass search "fastapi router implementation" --robot --limit 5

# View a specific result (from search output)
cass view /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 --json

# Expand context around a line
cass expand /path/to/session.jsonl -n 42 -C 3 --json

# Learn the full API
cass capabilities --json      # Feature discovery
cass robot-docs guide         # LLM-optimized docs
```

### Key Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--robot` / `--json` | Machine-readable JSON output (required!) |
| `--fields minimal` | Reduce payload: `source_path`, `line_number`, `agent` only |
| `--limit N` | Cap result count |
| `--agent NAME` | Filter to specific agent (claude, codex, cursor, etc.) |
| `--days N` | Limit to recent N days |

**stdout = data only, stderr = diagnostics. Exit 0 = success.**

### Pre-Flight Health Check

```bash
cass health --json
```

Returns in <50ms:
- **Exit 0:** Healthy—proceed with queries
- **Exit 1:** Unhealthy—run `cass index --full` first

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Retryable |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | Success | N/A |
| 1 | Health check failed | Yes—run `cass index --full` |
| 2 | Usage/parsing error | No—fix syntax |
| 3 | Index/DB missing | Yes—run `cass index --full` |

Treat cass as a way to avoid re-solving problems other agents already handled.

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses Beads for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# CLI commands for agents
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason="Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL
git add .beads/       # Stage beads changes
git commit -m "..."   # Commit beads state
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `br sync --flush-only` then `git add .beads/ && git commit` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** — Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) — Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update spec documents** — Ensure extraction/design docs are current
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** — This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Verify** — All changes committed AND pushed
6. **Hand off** — Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing — that leaves work stranded locally
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds


---

Note for Codex/GPT-5.2:

You constantly bother me and stop working with concerned questions that look similar to this:

```
Unexpected changes (need guidance)

- Working tree still shows edits I did not make in Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, src/cli/commands/upgrade.rs, src/storage/sqlite.rs, tests/conformance.rs, tests/storage_deps.rs. Please advise whether to keep/commit/revert these before any further work. I did not touch them.

Next steps (pick one)

1. Decide how to handle the unrelated modified files above so we can resume cleanly.
2. Triage beads_rust-orko (clippy/cargo warnings) and beads_rust-ydqr (rustfmt failures).
3. If you want a full suite run later, fix conformance/clippy blockers and re‑run cargo test --all.
```

NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN. The answer is literally ALWAYS the same: those are changes created by the potentially dozen of other agents working on the project at the same time. This is not only a common occurence, it happens multiple times PER MINUTE. The way to deal with it is simple: you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents. Just treat those changes identically to changes that you yourself made. Just fool yourself into think YOU made the changes and simply don't recall it for some reason.

---

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

Also, if I ask you to explicitly use your built-in TODO functionality, don't complain about this and say you need to use beads. You can use built-in TODOs if I tell you specifically to do so. Always comply with such orders.
